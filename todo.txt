1. store all arrival/departure times for a vehicle in `std::vector<boost::optional<uint64_T> >`s
2. clear once used in the likelihood 
3. project particles FORWARD until `t_k + 60` (i.e., a minute into the future).
   This should ensure particles *about* to reach the stop get the correct likelihood
4. implement the likelihood that depends on available data
   (in the case of multiple stops, just loop over them ...)
