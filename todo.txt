[x] store all arrival/departure times for a vehicle in `std::vector<boost::optional<uint64_T> >`s
2. clear once used in the likelihood 
[x] project particles FORWARD until `t_k + 60` (i.e., a minute into the future).
   This should ensure particles *about* to reach the stop get the correct likelihood
4. implement the likelihood that depends on available data
   (in the case of multiple stops, just loop over them ...)


- handle situation where bus doesn't actually move

- initialize segments using information in `networkstate.pb` file (if its ~recent)
  to aid recovery from crashes


[done]
- remove excess trajectory tail; i.e., only keep the last ~5 minutes worth? (and update `start` time accordingly)
 -> reduce memory demand!!
