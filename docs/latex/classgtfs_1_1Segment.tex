\subsection{Detailed Description}
An object of this class represents a vehicles path between two intersections.

The segment has a mean and variance of \char`\"{}speed\char`\"{} along it. At the beginning and end of routes, segments are defined from the first stop to the first intersection, and from the last intersection to the last stop, respectively. Each segment has a length, and consists of a sequence of \hyperlink{classgps_1_1Coord}{gps\+::\+Coord}\textquotesingle{}s which are in turn associated with a cumulative distance. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
