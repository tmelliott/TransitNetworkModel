Three parts, running in real time\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item particle filter for vehicle location and speed
\item Kalman filter for transit road network state (speed)
\item travel-\/ and arrival-\/time predictions for each vehicle/stop combination in the network
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{1. Particle Filter}

{\bfseries IN}\+: G\+T\+FS realtime protobuf feed

{\bfseries O\+UT}\+: (updated) vehicle objects with updated particle states

\subsubsection*{2. Kalman filter}

{\bfseries IN}\+: particle filter state estimates, road state at time {\ttfamily now -\/ delta}

{\bfseries O\+UT}\+: road state at time {\ttfamily now}

\subsubsection*{3. Predictions}

{\bfseries IN}\+: particle filter state estimates, road state estimates

{\bfseries O\+UT}\+: E\+TA to remaining stops along route



 \subsection*{Dependencies}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C\+Make
\item (optional) Doxygen (for making the Documentation)
\item (optional) https\+://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md \char`\"{}\+Google protobuf compiler `protoc`\char`\"{} (install with {\ttfamily make protoc})
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{To-\/do}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Application to run indefinitely
\item Use a {\ttfamily Vehicle} object concept with
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily vector$<$Particle$>$ (N)}
\item {\ttfamily void update (gtfs\+::\+Vehicle\+Position, gtfs\+::\+Trip\+Update)}\+: adjust the position, arrival/departure times etc, trigger particle transitions
\item {\ttfamily void resample (N)}\+: perform particle filter weighted resample
\item properties {\ttfamily vehicle\+\_\+id}, {\ttfamily timestamp}, {\ttfamily trip\+\_\+id}, {\ttfamily route\+\_\+id}, {\ttfamily position}, {\ttfamily stop\+\_\+sequence}, {\ttfamily arrival\+\_\+time}, {\ttfamily departure\+\_\+time}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item And the particles work in memory only
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Particle}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily void initialize ()}
\item {\ttfamily void transition ()}
\item {\ttfamily void calc\+\_\+likelihood ()}\+: uses parent Vehicle
\item {\ttfamily void calc\+\_\+weight ()}
\item properties {\ttfamily distance}, {\ttfamily velocity}, {\ttfamily stop\+\_\+index}, {\ttfamily arrival\+\_\+time}, {\ttfamily departure\+\_\+time}, {\ttfamily segment\+\_\+index}, {\ttfamily queue\+\_\+time}, {\ttfamily begin\+\_\+time}, {\ttfamily likelihood}, {\ttfamily weight}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Similar concept for network route segments
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Segment}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily vector$<$Path$>$ shape}\+: the G\+PS coordinates and cumulative distance of segment shape
\item {\ttfamily double speed}
\item {\ttfamily void update ()}\+: perform Kalman filter update, using particle summaries (?)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The G\+T\+FS information can either be
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item loaded into an S\+Q\+Lite database, or
\item loaded into a M\+E\+M\+O\+RY table via My\+S\+QL
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Vehicle state summaries can be written to a file (?)
\item Making information available (via server) -\/ road segment speeds + arrival time predictions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item database (with no foreign key checks, and no transaction?)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

(?) best way of collecting vehicle/segment data
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sequentially append speed estimates to {\ttfamily Segment}, then periodically update and clear?
\item write to file? (makes keeping history easier?)
\end{DoxyItemize}
