{\ttfamily \#include $<$gtfs.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
An object of this class represents an intersection.

Intersections are (for now) either traffic lights or roundabouts, but in future will encompass all physical intersections. Each intersection will eventually get a mean and variance for delay at that intersection to represent the typical delay at that intersection. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
